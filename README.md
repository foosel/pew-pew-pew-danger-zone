# Pew Pew Pew: Danger Zone!

*Lose health, gain bullets! Shoot or get shot! Collect powerups! Beat the boss and the highscore!*

"Pew Pew Pew: Danger Zone!" is a minimalistic shmup with bullet hell tendencies, created during [Go Godot Jam 4](https://itch.io/jam/go-godot-jam-4). The theme was "LESS IS MORE", and thus, the less health you have, the more bullets you shoot.

For a look behind the scenes, take a look at [this thread on my Mastodon account](https://chaos.social/@foosel/110321340611941751).

You can play it on its itch.io page: https://foosel.itch.io/pew-pew-pew-danger-zone
